# `accesscontrol`

## Abstract

This document specifies the accesscontrol module in EmpowerChain.

EmpowerChain users will have different permissions, depending on their role in the system, therefore there is a need to restrict access to specific messages for specific accounts only. Dedicated module is used to achieve that, so permissions can be enforced in a common way throughout all chain modules.
