# `proofofexistence`

## Abstract

This document specifies the proofofexistence module in EmpowerChain.

The module enables uploading a proof of existence of any document or piece of data, by hashing the data and uploading it to be stored on-chain.
The combination of Blockchain immutability and hashing integrity allows for anyone to prove later that a piece of data:
1. The data existed at least at the time it was added on-chain
2. It has not changed since then
