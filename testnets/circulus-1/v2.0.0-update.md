# v2.0.0 Upgrade

The upgrade is scheduled for block `2790000`, which should be about _15:00 CET on 24th November 2023_.

These instructions assume you are running Cosmovisor.
NOTE: Cosmovisor will preform a full backup unless `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true` is set as an environment variable.

### Go version

Go version 1.20.x is required to run the upgrade.

### Build

```bash
# get the new version (run inside the repo)
git fetch origin --tags
git checkout v2.0.0-rc1
cd chain && make build && make install

# check the version - should be v2.0.0-rc1
$HOME/go/bin/empowerd version
> 2.0.0-rc1
# make a dir if you haven't
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2/bin

# if you are using cosmovisor you then need to copy this new binary
cp /home/<your-user>/go/bin/empowerd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2/bin

# find out what version you are about to run - should be v2.0.0-rc1
