# How it works

EmpowerChain, a decentralized platform for the circular economy, is revolutionizing the way materials and products are tracked, recycled, and reused, paving the way for a more sustainable and economically viable future. This chapter will outline the various components of EmpowerChain and describe the mechanisms that enable it to facilitate the circular economy.

As outlined in [What is EmpowerChain](./what-is-empowerchain.md#how-does-empowerchain-work), EmpowerChain consists of a series of interconnected applications and tools that incentivize and facilitate collaboration and economic alignment towards circular economy.

## Creating plastic credits as collection incentives

EmpowerChain also facilitates the issuance of Plastic Credits (PCRDs), which incentivize collection organizations, sorting facilities, and recyclers to handle waste materials responsibly. PCRDs can be traded, used as proof of offset, or applied in gamification strategies to promote better waste management practices and drive circular economy efforts.

To read more about plastic credits, please refer to the [Plastic Credits](../core-modules/plastic-credits/high-level-overview.md) section.

## Ensuring Traceability and Transparency

EmpowerChain uses blockchain technology to create a secure and reliable foundation for traceability. By employing cryptographic hashing and the immutability of blockchain, EmpowerChain ensures that tracking data points, such as material flows or product lifecycles, remain tamper-proof and transparent.

The initial application to support this on EmpowerChain is the Proof of Existence (PoE) module, which you can read more about [here](../core-modules/proof-of-existence/high-level-overview.md).

## Creating Deposit Schemes

EmpowerChain supports the development of customizable incentive schemes designed to encourage material and product collection and recycling. These deposit systems can be tailored to the unique requirements of various actors, including Extended Producer Responsibility organizations, recyclers, or volunteer cleanup initiatives. Incentive schemes can take the form of monetary rewards or gamification strategies and are adaptable to a global audience.

## Encouraging Collaboration and Innovation

### Open and Decentralized Platform
The open and decentralized nature of EmpowerChain enables seamless collaboration among different stakeholders in the circular economy, from producers and recyclers to consumers and policymakers. By fostering cooperation, EmpowerChain promotes knowledge-sharing and innovation, helping overcome challenges in the transition to a circular economy.

### Supporting Future Applications
EmpowerChain's flexible and adaptable platform is designed to accommodate future applications, tools, and innovations that will advance the circular economy. By promoting continuous improvement and growth, EmpowerChain contributes to the development of a thriving circular economy ecosystem.

## Conclusion

EmpowerChain effectively facilitates the circular economy by ensuring traceability and transparency, creating incentive schemes, and encouraging collaboration and innovation. As more stakeholders participate in and contribute to the EmpowerChain ecosystem, the platform holds the potential to become a transformative force for change, leading to a more sustainable and economically viable future.
