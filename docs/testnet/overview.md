# Overview Circulus Testnet

Welcome to the EmpowerChain incentivized testnet: Circulus!

Here you will find information about the testnet, how to join and participate, and how to reap the rewards!

## Phases

The testnet is split into three phases:
1. 31st May - 6th June: Network bootstrap phase: this is only relevant for validators
2. 7th June - 20th June: Main phase: this is for everyone
3. 21st June - 25th June: Stress test phase: this is also for everyone, but will be focused on spamming the network

(After this we launch! 28th of June is the target date for mainnet launch.)

## Prizes

This will be written elsewhere too, but it bears repeating:
**all rewards will be vested linearly for 1 year (linear access to the rewards over 1 year).
All prices will be rewarded as $MPWR tokens to be vested for 1 year.**

The rest of the prizes are specified in a separate document outlining the different tasks and their rewards. This will be released before the main phase starts.
