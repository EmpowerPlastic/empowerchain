# Overview Circulus Testnet

Welcome to the EmpowerChain incentivized testnet: Circulus!

Here you will find information about the testnet, how to join and participate, and how to reap the rewards!

To read the rules and to find out if you are eligible to participate, please read the [rules](rules.md).

## Prizes

This will be written elsewhere too, but it bears repeating:
**all rewards will be vested linearly for 1 year (linear access to the rewards over 1 year).
All prices will be rewarded as $MPWR tokens to be vested for 1 year.**

The rest of the prizes are specified in a separate document outlining the different tasks and their rewards. This will be released before the main phase starts.

## Phases

The testnet is split into three phases:
1. 31st May - 6th June: Network bootstrap phase: this is only relevant for validators (builders can start to build of course)
2. 7th June - 20th June: Main phase: this is for everyone (testers, builders, validators)
3. 21st June - 25th June: Stress test phase: this is also for everyone, but will be focused on spamming the network

(After this we launch! 28th of June is the target date for mainnet launch.)

### 31st May - 6th June: Network bootstrap phase
In this phase we will launch the network and make sure everything is working smoothly.

A small group of validators has been asked to help us launch the network.
This does _not_ necessarly mean anything for the final mainnet gentx and delegation program selection.
It only means that we have asked them to help us launch the network.

For more information about the validator selection process, please read the [delegation program](../validators/delegation-program.md).

This phase is only relevant for validators, but builders can start building as per the [builders challenges](build-challenges.md).

### 7th June - 20th June: Main phase
In this phase we will test the network and the different applications that have been built on top of it.

Tasks will be released before this phase starts.

### 21st June - 25th June: Stress test phase
For a few days we will ask everyone to spam the network with transactions to see how it holds up.

Pretty basic stuff.

### 28th June: Mainnet launch
This is the target date for mainnet launch.

If all goes well we will get everyone's rewards programmed into genesis,
but if we don't manage to do that safely in time we will instead
