# Testnet rules

When you sign up for the EmpowerChain incentivized testnet, you're agreeing to our guidelines and the choices made by our Admins and Moderators. 
If you want to earn a reward, you must follow these rules and meet all the other conditions mentioned here.

Rules can change at any time but will, in that case, be announced on EmpowerChain’s Discord.

## Prizes

This will be written elsewhere too, but it bears repeating: 
**all rewards will be vested linearly for 1 year (linear access to the rewards over 1 year). 
All prices will be rewarded as $MPWR tokens to be vested for 1 year.**

The rest of the prizes are specified in a separate document outlining the different tasks and their rewards. This will be released before the main phase starts.

## Judging criteria and submissions

The criteria for each task and how to submit them will be detailed in a separate document to be released before the main phase starts.

## Eligibility requirements

- All users need to be registered for the incentivized testnet.
- Users must be at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction where they live when joining the EmpowerChain incentivized testnet.
- Users must be legally capable to participate under the regulations of their homeland. KYC might be required when claiming rewards.
- Users must be legally capable of receiving rewards and crypto transactions (if they win), and are responsible for settling any tax liabilities on the reward winnings.
- Users from the US are not eligible for rewards (sorry, it’s just too risky)
- Users might be asked to prove humanhood (i.e. not being bots) if Empower sees a high risk of this being the case
- Employees of Empower or subcontractors are not eligible for rewards

## Participation rules

- All users need to have joined the EmpowerChain Discord
- Only submit work you have actually done. Copying others work, or obviously scripting or circumventing the challenges in any way is reason for immediate disqualification (and obviously any rewards are forfeited)
- Don’t abuse the testnet faucet. No points are given out for having a bunch of tokens. If we see that you are scripting or otherwise abusing the testnet faucet to get into the active set, you will be disqualified.

## Code of conduct

Be kind. Don’t be a bully. The EmpowerChain community is a safe place where everyone should feel welcome and seen. 
If you see something, say something. This includes everything from name-calling to racism and sexual harassment, and so on. Just be a decent human being, and everyone will be fine. Unnecessary trolling will also not be tolerated.

Attacking the network is part of the testing, but don’t ruin it for everyone. Showcase the vulnerability and get rewarded for it, but if you attack node operators or screw up the network for everyone for no good reason, you will not be eligible for rewards.

The Empower team reserves the right to remove and disqualify anyone who doesn’t uphold these rules.

## Disclaimer

Empower holds the right to change the rules, prices, tasks, or any other part of the program at any time if deemed necessary for the soundness of the incentivized testnet and its goals.

## Another legal disclaimer, just for good measure

Essentially: We can’t give out rewards to US citizens. Please don’t try to fool us into doing so…
