# Coding Guidelines

As we implement and learn new things that are currently not covered in book.cosmwasm.com or other docs, let's make PR's to the CosmWasm book repo to help out with the efforts to get CosmWasm a better DX.

## Where to ask for help

The CosmWasm Discord is typically the best place to find developers who can answer questions: http://chat.cosmwasm.com/
